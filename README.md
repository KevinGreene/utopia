# Utopia


## Background

In this game, players take on the role of gods, trying to craft a world where they reign supreme. To do this, they must speak, bringing about creation and destruction with their mere words.


## Magic

Magic is made up of intents and objects, or verbs and nouns. When a player plays a spell, they will pick the intent of one card and the object of another.



### Intents

* Create - Add a cube of the corresponding color to target hex
* Destroy - Remove a cube of the corresponding color to target hex
* Consecrate - Add a white cube or remove a black cube from target hex containing a cube of the corresponding color.
* Desecrate - Add a black cube or remove a white cube from target hex containing a cube of the corresponding color.
* Move - Move a cube of the corresponding color from one hex to another.


### Objects

* Water - Blue
* Earth - Brown
* Civilization - Yellow
* Animals - Red
* Plants - Green


## Setup

First, layout the tiles / take the hex sheets. It should be a regular hexagon with side length 6. 

Then, for each hex, draw a power card. Add the object on the card to the hex.

Then, shuffle all power cards, and all ruler cards. Deal four cards of each type to each player. Last person to affect the landscape goes first.


## Gameplay

(2 options for play)

Option 1:
On your turn, you must play all four cards in your hand.

To speak, pick two cards. Use the intent (verb) of one, and the object (noun) of another. This will let you add, remove, or move a cube.

Each time you speak, you may appease a ruler card from your hand. Draw a new ruler.

After you've played all cards in your hand, draw 4 more cards, then move to the next player.

Option 2:
To speak, play two cards, one upside down. Cast both spells shown. Draw 2 replacement cards.

## Game End and Scoring

After 12 rounds, the game ends.

Add all victory points from completed rulers who score bonus points. In addition, for each race, the person with the most of that race earns the title "Leader of [Race]" worth 5 VPs.

God cards also may add more victory points, through favored races / classes, points for elements on the board, points for tiles, or other options

## World

The idea behind the game is that you'll end up with a world that can be used as the basis of an RPG world, or map, or even the base setup for a more involved worldbuilding game like Dawn of Worlds or Microscope.
